Bank XYZ,

Can you share details of the monthly fee structure? We see **$50** listed as a maintenance fee—what exactly does this cover?  

Loan Account Details:

Bank Name: XYZ BANK, NA

ABA Number: 451000876

Account No.: XXXXXXXXX890

There’s a **$100** fee adjustment for a loan amendment recently. Could you confirm if this has been applied correctly? We'd like to understand more about the **$300** reallocation fee charged last week—was it tied to our request for redistributing principal payments?

Thanks and regards, 
Francis
