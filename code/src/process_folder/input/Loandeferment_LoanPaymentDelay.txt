Subject: Request for Deferment for Loan Account

Dear Manager,

I hope this message finds you well. I am writing to formally request deferment for my loan account (Account Number: 1234987650)and loan amount of 150,000 due to my company currently experiencing financial losses.

Given the circumstances, I would like to request the following:

The possibility of deferring payments until 03-10-2025, after which I can resume regular payments.

I understand the importance of my obligations and assure you that I am committed to fulfilling my loan responsibilities. However, due to the current financial challenges my company is facing, these measures would provide necessary relief.

Please let me know the required documentation and any additional steps I need to take to process this request.

Thank you for your understanding and support during this time. I look forward to your prompt response.

Sincerely,

August
