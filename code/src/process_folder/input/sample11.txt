Bank XYZ,

We’ve scheduled a payment of **$10,000** due on **30th March 2025**. Can you confirm receipt once processed?

Loan Account Details:

Bank Name: XYZ BANK, NA

ABA Number: 451000876

We’re planning a partial prepayment of **$5,000** soon. Could you confirm how this would impact the interest accrual?

Thanks and regards,
