Subject: Disbursement Request for Loan and Clarification of Schedules

Dear Loan Officer,

I hope this message finds you well. I am writing to formally request the disbursement of my approved loan amounting to $500,000, which was approved on 03-01-2025.

Additionally, I would like clarification on the following aspects of the loan schedule:

Confirmation of the proposed disbursement schedule, which includes 3 payments of $200,000, $150,000, and $150,000 within a 6-month period.

Additionally, I would like to request a modification to the repayment structure to change from a 3-payment schedule to a 4-payment schedule, while maintaining a loan term of 10 years. In this context, could you please clarify whether the interest rate would differ in this new repayment scenario?

Thank you for your attention to this matter. I look forward to your prompt response so I can proceed accordingly.

Best regards,

April
