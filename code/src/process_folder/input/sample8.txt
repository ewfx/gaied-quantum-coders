Bank XYZ,

I hope you're doing well. 

Could you confirm the upcoming repricing on 20th November 2025, and share the new SOFR (US) Term rate that will apply?

Weâ€™d like to discuss the possibility of repricing the interest rate for the remaining principal balance of $1,764,705.88. Are there options available to adjust to a more favorable rate based on current market conditions?

Loan Account Details:

Bank Name: XYZ BANK, NA

ABA Number: 451000876

Account No.: XXXXXXXXX890

Please share a breakdown of any fees associated with repricing adjustments and let us know if borrower authorization is required for this change.

Thanks and regards, 
Francis
