Subject: Request for Loan Modification

Dear Bank Manager,

I hope this message finds you well. I am writing to formally request a modification of my existing loan.

Currently, my loan is set for $250,000, and I would like to change this amount to $300,000. Additionally, I request an increase in the loan payment term by one year while keeping the interest rate the same.

These adjustments are necessary to better align with my financial needs and project requirements. I would greatly appreciate your guidance on the process involved in making these modifications and any documentation that may be required.

Please let me know if there are any additional steps I need to take or if further information is needed from my side.

Thank you for your attention to this matter. I look forward to your prompt response.

Sincerely,

May
Manager,ABC
