# Duplicate Email Detection 
This project is an AI-based email and attachment processing system designed to detect duplicates using advanced natural language processing (NLP) and machine learning techniques. It leverages embeddings generated by models like BERT and compares them using cosine similarity to identify duplicates.

---

## Functionality

### Key Features:
1. **Email Text Processing**:
   - Extracts and processes the text content of emails.
   - Generates embeddings for email text using pre-trained models like BERT.

2. **Attachment Processing**:
   - Supports multiple file types, including:
     - **PDFs**: Extracts text using `pdfplumber`.
     - **Word Documents**: Extracts text using `python-docx`.
     - **Images**: Extracts text using OCR (Optical Character Recognition).
     - **Plain Text Files**: Reads and processes `.txt` files.
   - Generates embeddings for the extracted text from attachments.

3. **Duplicate Detection**:
   - Compares embeddings of emails and attachments using cosine similarity.
   - Flags duplicates if the similarity exceeds a configurable threshold.

4. **RESTful API**:
   - Built using **FastAPI** for easy integration.
   - Provides endpoints for processing emails and attachments.

## Setup Instructions

### Prerequisites:
1. **Python**:
   - Ensure Python 3.8 or higher is installed. You can download it from [python.org](https://www.python.org/).

2. **Virtual Environment (Optional but Recommended)**:
   - Create a virtual environment to isolate dependencies.

3. **Install Required Libraries**:
   - Install the dependencies listed in the `requirements.txt` file.
